    "# Introduction to Python\n",

    "*Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used interactively, allowing for very rapid development. Python has many powerful scientific computing tools, making it an ideal language for applied and computational mathematics. In this introductory lab we introduce Python syntax, data types, functions, and control flow tools. These Python basics are an essential part of almost every problem you will solve and almost every program you will write.*\n",

    "Python is quickly gaining momentum as a fundamental tool in scientific computing. *Anaconda* is a free distribution service by Continuum Analytics, Inc., that includes the cross-platform Python *interpreter* (the software that actually executes Python code) and many Python libraries that are commonly used for applied and computational mathematics. To install Python via Anaconda, go to http://continuum.io/downloads, download the installer for Python 3.6 corresponding to your operating system, and follow the on-screen instructions. Python 2.7 is still popular in the scientific community (as of 2017), but more and more libraries are moving support to Python 3.\n",
