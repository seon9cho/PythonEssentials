    "# Introduction to Python\n",

    "*Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used interactively, allowing for very rapid development. Python has many powerful scientific computing tools, making it an ideal language for applied and computational mathematics. In this introductory lab we introduce Python syntax, data types, functions, and control flow tools. These Python basics are an essential part of almost every problem you will solve and almost every program you will write.*\n",

    "Python is quickly gaining momentum as a fundamental tool in scientific computing. *Anaconda* is a free distribution service by Continuum Analytics, Inc., that includes the cross-platform Python *interpreter* (the software that actually executes Python code) and many Python libraries that are commonly used for applied and computational mathematics. To install Python via Anaconda, go to http://continuum.io/downloads, download the installer for Python 3.6 corresponding to your operating system, and follow the on-screen instructions. Python 2.7 is still popular in the scientific community (as of 2017), but more and more libraries are moving support to Python 3.\n",

    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python `set` is an unordered collection of distinct objects. Objects can be added to or removed\n",
    "from a set after its creation. Initialize a set with curly braces `{ }`, separating the values by commas,\n",
    "or use `set()` to create an empty set. Like mathematical sets, Python sets have operations like union,\n",
    "intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"border: 2px solid #242300ff; border-radius: 8px; padding: 10px; background: #3b3a11ff; display: inline-block; max-width: fit-content;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Initialize some sets. Note that repeats are not added.\n",
    ">>> gym_members = {\"Doe, John\", \"Doe, John\", \"Smith, Jane\", \"Brown, Bob\"}\n",
    ">>> print(gym_members)\n",
    "{'Doe, John', 'Brown, Bob', 'Smith, Jane'}\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> gym_members.add(\"Lytle, Josh\")          # Add an object to the set.\n",

    ">>> print(gym_members)\n",

    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a set, a Python `dict` (dictionary) is an unordered data type. A dictionary stores key-value\n",
    "pairs, called `items`. The values of a dictionary are indexed by its keys. Dictionaries are initialized\n",
    "with curly braces, colons, and commas. Use `dict()` or `{}` to create an empty dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"border: 2px solid #242300ff; border-radius: 8px; padding: 10px; background: #3b3a11ff; display: inline-block; max-width: fit-content;\">\n",

    "As far as data access goes, lists are like dictionaries whose keys are the integers $0, 1, . . . , n − 1$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of items in the list. The keys of a dictionary need not be integers, but they\n",
    "must be *immutable*, which means that they must be objects that cannot be modified after creation.\n",
    "We will discuss mutability more thoroughly in the Standard Library lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "The names of each of Python’s data types can be used as functions to cast a value as that type. This\n",
    "is particularly useful for converting between integers and floats.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Cast numerical values as different kinds of numerical values.\n",
    ">>> x = int(3.0)\n",
    ">>> y = float(3)\n",
    ">>> z = complex(3)\n",
    ">>> print(x, y, z)\n",
    "3 3.0 (3+0j)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cast a list as a set and vice versa.\n",
    ">>> set([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])\n",
    "{1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
